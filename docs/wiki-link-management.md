# Wiki Link Management - Unix Philosophy Split Architecture

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Production-ready split architecture
**Scope**: Refactored unified watcher into two composable Unix tools

---

## Executive Summary

Transformed the wiki link management system from a monolithic unified watcher into two independent, composable tools following Unix "do one thing well" philosophy. This enables users to enable features independently while maintaining zero efficiency penalty through event-driven architecture.

### The Transformation

**Before**: Single `wiki-link-manager` combining both features (forced on all users)
**After**: Two independent watchers that can be used separately or together

```
wiki-backlinks       → Maintains ## Backlinks sections only
wiki-resolve-mark    → Marks/unmarks ?[[ for missing targets only
link-service         → Manages both (or either) as needed
```

---

## Architecture Overview

### Two Independent Watchers

#### 1. **`wiki-backlinks`** - Automatic Bidirectional Backlink Maintenance

**Purpose**: Maintains `## Backlinks` sections across all notes

**Features**:
- Automatic backlink generation when files are created/modified
- Handles file renames (updates all references)
- Cross-directory support (Forge, Admin, Archives)
- Event-driven (zero CPU when idle)
- Grep-on-demand (no index overhead)

**Operations**:
- **Create**: Updates backlinks if new file contains links
- **Write**: Updates backlinks for all linked files
- **Rename**: Updates link text in all referencing files
- **Remove**: No action (backlinks naturally disappear)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Standalone usage
wiki-backlinks [--debounce-ms 2000]

# Managed via service
link-service start  # Starts backlinks + resolve-mark
```

#### 2. **`wiki-resolve-mark`** - Unresolved Link Marker

**Purpose**: Visually marks broken wiki links with `?[[` prefix

**Features**:
- Marks `[[link]]` → `?[[link]]` when target doesn't exist
- Cleans `?[[link]]` → `[[link]]` when file is created
- Smart filtering (excludes UUIDs, system paths, auto-generated files)
- Cross-directory support (Forge, Admin, Archives)
- Event-driven (zero CPU when idle)

**Smart Filter Configuration** (prevents false positives):
- Action prefixes: `tel:`, `mailto:`, `http:`, `https:`, `obsidian:`
- System paths: `C:`, `/usr/`, `/var/`, `~/`
- Auto-generated: `IMG_*`, `Screenshot*`, `Pasted image *`
- UUIDs: 32/40/64 character hexadecimal strings
- Reserved names: Windows reserved (CON, PRN, AUX, etc.)
- Symlink dirs: `linked_media/`, `attachments/`, `assets/`
- Invalid chars: `\ / : * ? " < > |`
- Length: 2-100 characters

**Operations**:
- **Create**: Cleans `?[[filename]]` markers across all files
- **Write**: Marks new unresolved links in modified file
- **Rename**: Updates markers in all references
- **Remove**: Marks all references to deleted file as unresolved

**Usage**:
```bash
# Standalone usage
wiki-resolve-mark [--debounce-ms 2000]

# Managed via service
link-service start  # Starts backlinks + resolve-mark
```

### Service Management Layer

#### **`link-service`** - Unified Service Controller

**Purpose**: Manages multiple watcher instances across directories

**Multi-Instance Architecture**:
```
For each directory (Forge, Admin, Archives):
  Spawn wiki-backlinks watcher
  Spawn wiki-resolve-mark watcher

Example with 2 directories:
  Forge:
    - wiki-backlinks (PID 37584)
    - wiki-resolve-mark (PID 37600)

  Admin:
    - wiki-backlinks (PID 37630)
    - wiki-resolve-mark (PID 37646)

Total: 4 watchers (2 directories × 2 features)
```

**Commands**:
```bash
link-service start    # Start all watchers
link-service stop     # Stop all watchers
link-service restart  # Restart all watchers
link-service status   # Show watcher status
link-service logs     # Show recent activity
link-service errors   # Show error logs
```

**Log Files**:
```
~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/
  backlinks-Forge.out.log       # Backlinks output for Forge
  backlinks-Forge.err.log       # Backlinks errors for Forge
  backlinks-Admin.out.log       # Backlinks output for Admin
  backlinks-Admin.err.log       # Backlinks errors for Admin
  resolve-Forge.out.log         # Resolve-mark output for Forge
  resolve-Forge.err.log         # Resolve-mark errors for Forge
  resolve-Admin.out.log         # Resolve-mark output for Admin
  resolve-Admin.err.log         # Resolve-mark errors for Admin
  link-service.pid              # Comma-separated PIDs
```

## Unix Philosophy Benefits

### 1. **Do One Thing Well**

Each tool has a single, clear responsibility:
- `wiki-backlinks` → Backlink maintenance only
- `wiki-resolve-mark` → Link resolution marking only

**Easier to**:
- Test in isolation
- Debug specific feature issues
- Understand code organization
- Maintain over time

### 2. **Composability**

Users can enable features independently:

**Backlinks Only**:
```bash
# Run just the backlinks watcher
wiki-backlinks
```

**Resolve Marking Only**:
```bash
# Run just the resolve-mark watcher
wiki-resolve-mark
```

**Both Features**:
```bash
# Service manages both
link-service start
```

### 3. **Customizability for Open Source**

Perfect for `nushell-knowledge-tools` repository:
- Users pick which features they want
- No forcing both features on everyone
- Mix and match based on workflow
- Extend one without affecting the other

### 4. **No Efficiency Penalty**

**Common Misconception**: "Separate watchers = redundant work"

**Reality**: Event-driven architecture means zero redundancy
- Both watchers respond to **same filesystem events**
- No duplicate file scanning
- No performance degradation
- Same efficiency as unified watcher

**How It Works**:
```
Filesystem Event: note.md modified

Operating System: Triggers FSEvents/inotify

wiki-backlinks:    Receives event → Updates backlinks
wiki-resolve-mark: Receives event → Checks/marks links

Both process the SAME event in parallel
No additional filesystem access needed
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Technology**:
- **macOS**: FSEvents (kernel-level file system monitoring)
- **Linux**: inotify (kernel-level file system monitoring)
- **Nushell**: `watch` command wrapping native OS APIs

**Zero Idle Overhead**:
- Watchers sleep until filesystem events occur
- Kernel wakes process when files change
- No polling, no CPU usage when idle
- Instant response to changes

### Multi-Directory Support

**Watched Directories**:
```nushell
let forge = $"($env.HOME)/Forge"
let admin = $"($env.HOME)/Admin"
let archives = $"($env.HOME)/Archives"

# Only watch directories that exist
let watch_dirs = ([$forge, $admin, $archives] | where {|p| $p | path exists})
```

**Cross-Directory Link Resolution**:
```nushell
# Searches all watched directories for target file
def find_target_file [link_name: string, watch_paths: list] {
    for dir in $existing_paths {
        let exact_match = try {
            ^fd -t f $"^($link_name).md$" $dir | lines | first
        }
        if not ($exact_match | is-empty) {
            return $exact_match
        }
    }
    return ""
}
```

**Bidirectional Updates**:
- Change in Forge → Updates Admin, Archives, Forge
- Change in Admin → Updates Forge, Archives, Admin
- Change in Archives → Updates Forge, Admin, Archives

### Grep-on-Demand Strategy

**No Index Maintenance**:
- No database to keep in sync
- No background indexing jobs
- No stale data issues
- No index corruption recovery

**Live Queries**:
```nushell
# Find all files linking to a note
for dir in $existing_paths {
    let links = ^rg -l $'\\[\\[($file_name)\\]\\]' $dir --glob "*.md" | lines
}
```

**Performance**:
- Ripgrep is extremely fast (written in Rust)
- Only searches when events occur (not constantly)
- Handles 6,000+ files efficiently
- No noticeable latency

## Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Note

**Action**: Create `~/Forge/New-Topic.md` with content:
```markdown
# New Topic

See also [[Related-Note]] and [[Another-Note]]
```

**Backlinks Watcher**:
1. Detects file creation event
2. Extracts links: `Related-Note`, `Another-Note`
3. Finds target files (if they exist)
4. Updates `## Backlinks` in both target files to include `[[New-Topic]]`

**Resolve-Mark Watcher**:
1. Detects file creation event
2. Searches for `?[[New-Topic]]` in all files
3. Cleans to `[[New-Topic]]` (removes `?` marker)

### Example 2: Editing an Existing Note

**Action**: Add `[[Non-Existent]]` link to `~/Forge/My-Note.md`

**Backlinks Watcher**:
1. Detects file modification event
2. Extracts new link: `Non-Existent`
3. Searches for target file (not found)
4. No backlink update (file doesn't exist)

**Resolve-Mark Watcher**:
1. Detects file modification event
2. Extracts link: `Non-Existent`
3. Checks if target exists (not found)
4. Marks as unresolved: `[[Non-Existent]]` → `?[[Non-Existent]]`

### Example 3: Renaming a Note

**Action**: Rename `~/Forge/Old-Name.md` → `~/Forge/New-Name.md`

**Backlinks Watcher**:
1. Detects file rename event
2. Searches for all files containing `[[Old-Name]]`
3. Updates link text: `[[Old-Name]]` → `[[New-Name]]` in all files
4. Updates backlinks in the renamed file itself

**Resolve-Mark Watcher**:
1. Detects file rename event
2. Searches for all files containing `[[Old-Name]]` or `?[[Old-Name]]`
3. Updates markers: Both regular and unresolved links get new name
4. Preserves `?` marker state (stays unresolved if it was)

### Example 4: Deleting a Note

**Action**: Delete `~/Forge/Deleted-Note.md`

**Backlinks Watcher**:
1. Detects file deletion event
2. Logs deletion
3. No action (backlinks naturally disappear from deleted file)
4. Other files still have `[[Deleted-Note]]` links (not automatically removed)

**Resolve-Mark Watcher**:
1. Detects file deletion event
2. Searches for all files containing `[[Deleted-Note]]`
3. Marks as unresolved: `[[Deleted-Note]]` → `?[[Deleted-Note]]`
4. Visual indicator that target is missing

---

## Migration Guide

### From Unified to Split Architecture

**No Action Required** if using `link-service`:
- `link-service start` automatically uses split architecture
- All commands work identically
- Log locations have changed (feature-specific)

**If Running Manually**:

**Before**:
```bash
wiki-link-manager &
```

**After** (both features):
```bash
wiki-backlinks &
wiki-resolve-mark &
```

**After** (just backlinks):
```bash
wiki-backlinks &
```

**After** (just resolve marking):
```bash
wiki-resolve-mark &
```

### Configuration Changes

**Log Directory**:
```bash
# Old
~/scripts/wiki-link-manager/logs/linkmanager.out.log

# New
~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/backlinks-Forge.out.log
~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/resolve-Forge.out.log
```

**PID File**:
```bash
# Old
~/scripts/wiki-link-manager/logs/linkmanager.pid

# New
~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/link-service.pid
```

**PID Format**:
```bash
# Old (single PID)
37584

# New (comma-separated PIDs for all watchers)
37584,37600,37630,37646
```

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Guidelines

**MANDATORY READING**: [File Watcher Safety Guidelines](./file-watcher-safety.md)

File watchers that modify watched files require **mandatory debouncing** to prevent runaway loops. A critical incident in October 2025 resulted in data corruption of 16 files when debounce protection was missing during a Python-to-Nushell migration.

**Key Safety Requirements**:
- ✅ Debouncing enabled with minimum 2000ms delay (already implemented)
- ✅ Integration testing before deployment (watch → modify → re-trigger cycle)
- ✅ Regular backups before script changes
- ✅ Corruption monitoring for early detection

**Current Status**: ✅ Both `wiki-backlinks` and `wiki-resolve-mark` include proper debouncing. All incidents have been resolved with complete recovery.

See [file-watcher-safety.md](./file-watcher-safety.md) for complete safety protocols, testing methodology, and recovery procedures.

## Troubleshooting

### Watchers Not Starting

**Symptom**: `link-service start` completes but no processes running

**Check**:
```bash
# View error logs
cat ~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/backlinks-Forge.err.log
cat ~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/resolve-Forge.err.log
```

**Common Causes**:
1. **Permission denied**: Scripts need execute permissions
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/dotfiles/scripts/wiki-backlinks
   chmod +x ~/dotfiles/scripts/wiki-resolve-mark
   ```

2. **Missing directories**: Forge, Admin, or Archives don't exist
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/Forge ~/Admin ~/Archives
   ```

3. **Nushell not found**: Script shebang points to wrong location
   ```bash
   which nu
   # Should show /usr/bin/nu or /opt/homebrew/bin/nu
   ```

### High CPU Usage

**Symptom**: Watcher processes consuming significant CPU

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Too many file changes**: Large batch operations triggering many events
2. **Debounce too low**: Increase debounce delay
   ```bash
   wiki-backlinks --debounce-ms 5000  # 5 seconds instead of 2
   ```

3. **Large files**: Processing very large markdown files
4. **Recursive links**: Circular link patterns

**Solutions**:
- Increase debounce delay
- Exclude large directories
- Check for infinite loop patterns in links

### Missing Backlinks

**Symptom**: Backlinks section not updating

**Check**:
1. **Is watcher running?**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep wiki-backlinks
   ```

2. **Are logs showing activity?**
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/scripts/wiki-link-management/logs/backlinks-Forge.out.log
   ```

3. **Is link format correct?**
   - Correct: `[[Note-Name]]`
   - Incorrect: `[Note-Name]` (single brackets)
   - Incorrect: `[[Note Name]]` (spaces in filename)

4. **Are directories being watched?**
   ```bash
   link-service status  # Shows watched directories
   ```

### Links Not Being Marked Unresolved

**Symptom**: `?[[` markers not appearing for missing links

**Check**:
1. **Is resolve-mark watcher running?**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep wiki-resolve-mark
   ```

2. **Is link being filtered?**
   - Links with `http:`, `mailto:`, etc. are excluded
   - UUIDs are excluded
   - Very short/long names are excluded
   - Check filter configuration in script

3. **Is file in watched directory?**
   - Only Forge, Admin, Archives are watched
   - Other directories won't be processed

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage

**CPU**:
- **Idle**: 0% (kernel wakes process only on events)
- **Active**: Brief spikes during processing (<1s per event)
- **No background polling**: Zero CPU between events

**Memory**:
- **Per watcher**: ~24MB resident memory
- **4 watchers**: ~96MB total
- **No index**: No memory overhead for file index
- **Grep caching**: OS file cache speeds up repeated searches

**Disk I/O**:
- **Event-driven only**: No background scanning
- **Grep queries**: Leverage OS file cache
- **Write batching**: Single write per file update
- **No database**: No index write overhead

### Scalability

**Tested With**:
- 6,400+ markdown files
- 2 watched directories
- 4 concurrent watchers
- Real-time performance

**Bottlenecks**:
- Ripgrep performance (very fast, written in Rust)
- Number of files linking to popular notes
- Filesystem event queue depth

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Debounce delay prevents rapid-fire processing
- Cross-directory search is parallelizable
- OS file cache speeds up repeated searches
- Nushell's native speed (also written in Rust)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

1. **Configurable Watched Directories**
   ```bash
   wiki-backlinks --watch ~/Forge --watch ~/Projects --watch ~/Research
   ```

2. **Smart Filtering Configuration File**
   ```yaml
   # ~/.config/wiki-resolve-mark/filters.yaml
   exclude_patterns:
     - "*.tmp"
     - "ARCHIVE-*"
   ```

3. **Backlink Formatting Options**
   ```bash
   wiki-backlinks --format "tree"  # Tree structure
   wiki-backlinks --format "flat"  # Flat list (current)
   wiki-backlinks --format "grouped"  # Grouped by directory
   ```

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```bash
   link-service stats  # Show processing times, event counts
   ```

5. **Dry-Run Mode**
   ```bash
   wiki-resolve-mark --dry-run  # Show what would be marked
   ```

6. **Selective Directory Watching**
   ```bash
   link-service start --backlinks-only Forge Admin
   link-service start --resolve-only Forge
   ```

### Extensibility Points

**Adding New Features**:
1. Create new watcher script (e.g., `wiki-link-validator`)
2. Add to `link-service` spawning loop
3. Follow same event-driven pattern
4. Add to Dotter configuration
5. Document in README

**Custom Event Handlers**:
```nushell
# Template for new watcher
watch $directory --glob "**/*.md" {|operation, file_path, new_path|
    match $operation {
        "Write" => { handle_write $file_path }
        "Create" => { handle_create $file_path }
        "Rename" => { handle_rename $file_path $new_path }
        "Remove" => { handle_remove $file_path }
    }
}
```

## Comparison: Unified vs. Split Architecture

| Aspect | Unified (Before) | Split (After) |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Scripts** | 1 combined script | 2 independent scripts |
| **User Choice** | All or nothing | Pick features independently |
| **Testing** | Test both together | Test each in isolation |
| **Debugging** | Hard to isolate issues | Clear feature boundaries |
| **Code Clarity** | 494 lines intertwined | 279 + 376 lines separated |
| **CPU Usage** | Same | Same (event-driven) |
| **Memory** | ~25MB per watcher | ~25MB per watcher |
| **Customizability** | Low | High |
| **Unix Philosophy** | No | Yes ✓ |
| **Open Source Appeal** | Limited | Strong ✓ |

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Split Instead of Unified?

**Initial Concern**: "Won't two watchers be less efficient?"

**Answer**: No - event-driven architecture means both respond to same events

**Reasoning**:
1. **Same Events**: Both watchers receive identical filesystem events
2. **No Redundancy**: Each processes only its specific feature
3. **Parallel Processing**: Can happen simultaneously
4. **OS Efficiency**: Kernel manages event distribution

**Analogy**:
```
Think of filesystem events like a radio broadcast:

Unified:    One receiver picking up all channels
Split:      Two receivers tuned to same broadcast
            Each extracts different information
            Same signal, different processing
            No efficiency loss
```

### Why Deprecate Instead of Delete Old Script?

**Reasoning**:
1. **Reference**: Shows historical approach
2. **Learning**: Helps understand evolution
3. **Safety**: Easy to revert if needed
4. **Documentation**: Explains why change was made

**Header Provides**:
- Clear deprecation warning
- Links to new tools
- Reason for split
- Migration path

### Why Service Layer for Multiple Watchers?

**Reasoning**:
1. **Unified Control**: Single command for all watchers
2. **Cross-Directory**: Handles multiple directories easily
3. **PID Management**: Tracks all processes
4. **Log Organization**: Centralized logging
5. **User Convenience**: Simpler than manual management

**Alternative Considered**: Manual process management
**Rejected Because**: Too much cognitive overhead for users

## Conclusion

The split architecture represents a **significant improvement** in system design:

✅ **Unix Philosophy**: True "do one thing well" approach
✅ **User Choice**: Enable features independently
✅ **Code Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns
✅ **Zero Efficiency Loss**: Same event-driven performance
✅ **Open Source Ready**: Customizable for community

This refactoring demonstrates that **good architecture and good performance are not mutually exclusive** - event-driven design enables both composability and efficiency.

The system is now **production-ready** for inclusion in the `nushell-knowledge-tools` repository with maximum flexibility for users.
